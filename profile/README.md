Video services like `Zoom` and `Google meet` only allow you to **share one screen at a time**, because they're **designed for video conferencing**, not screen sharing. As people increasingly share their screens to collaborate each other, this limitation has become an annoyance.

**`AirView` solves these problems.** `Airview` is a service for screen sharing! It supports the following features:
- __Screen Sharing__: View work on each other's devices without the need for a monitor or transmission process.
- __Quick Screen Switching__: Switch screens ridply when you want to see multiple users' screens at a glance or focus on one selected screen.
- __Drawing__: Draw on the screens when you want to provide feedback.
